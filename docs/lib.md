## User-Agent switcher

**PLEASE ENSURE YOU HAVE READ AND UNDERSTAND THE [DISCLAIMER](#disclaimer).**

Some endpoints of the Discord API have methods which can't be used by bots,
or libraries. As of now (2017-07-09), Discord uses the user-agent to detect
bots and libraries. Changing it can circumvent those limitations.

Disband.py has an integrated user-agent switcher, which is already present on
all necessary methods (see `@switch_agent` in the source). By default, it is
"disabled" by setting the alternative user-agent to the original one. [At your
own risk](#disclaimer), you can edit the alternative user-agent to enable the
user-agent switcher, and to use the full set of features:

```
client.http.alt_user_agent = 'Your custom User-Agent'
```

## Client methods

Those are regular client methods, like `send_message`.
